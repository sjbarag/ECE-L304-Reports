\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, step one was a success.  Students successfully simulated a
working ADC, DAC, and combined circuit, thus refreshing their familiarity with
the function of the devices.  While the converters used in the final voice
recorder circuit will be on ICs and not discrete components as in the
simulation, the behavior of the devices will be identical.  Additionally, the
low-level knowledge provided by the initial step will prove useful when
students are required to choose supply voltages and clock frequencies for the
final design.  By understanding how the various parameters affect each device's
properties, more informed and accurate decisions can now be made.
