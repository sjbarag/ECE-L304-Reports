\section{Analog to Digital Converter}
\subsection{Discrete ADC Simulation}
The initial stage of the voice recording circuit is an analog to digital
converter allowing the digital storage system to process the analog input from
an eletret microphone.  A simplified ADC schematic was provided in the lab
instructions, and was simulated with Cadence PSpice as shown in
Figure~\ref{f:adc_schem}.

This circuit was simulated using transient analysis lasting for
just~\SI{2}{\milli\second}.  Because of the~\SI{1}{\kilo\hertz} frequency of
the sinusoidal input signal, the system will be observed for two full input
periods, as shown in Figure~\ref{f:adc_plot}.

\subsection{Discrete ADC Results}
Upon the completion of the transient simulation, PSpice produced the plot
included in Figure~\ref{f:adc_plot}.

	``Clk'' nodes as indicated above.}

The plot reveals a lot of information about the function of this particular
ADC.  The value of the DAC line increases in discrete steps due to the binary
counter U3.  When the voltage on this line exceeds the input voltage, the latch
line goes low and triggers the D flip-flop U4 to produce the corresponding
digital bits D0 through D3.  At this point, the counter resets, latch goes
high, and the counting process repeats.  While this does provide accurate
digital representations of individual signals, it causes the rate of
measurement to increase for inputs with larger voltages as each value in the
count up process is analyzed for one clock period (in this
case~\SI{20}{\micro\second}).
