\section{Introduction}
The entirety of ECE-L304 is devoted to the design, construction, and debugging
of a digital voice recorder.  By providing students with an opportunity to
complete a project of larger scale than anything they have previously
attempted, the course offers its students valuable skills and experience with a
long-term engineering project.

As the system uses digital storage in the form of a RAM chip, it is necessary
to convert all input audio from its native analog form to a digital
representation.  Similarly, the stored digital representation must be converted
back to an analog signal so that it can be correctly rendered by a speaker.
These conversions are performed by an analog to digital converter (ADC) and a
digital to analog converter (DAC), resepectively.

In order to ease the design process, students first complete a simple ADC and
DAC simulation.  This helps to remind students of the operating properties and
behaviors of the two converters, as well as providing a schematic similar to
the one required in the final design.
