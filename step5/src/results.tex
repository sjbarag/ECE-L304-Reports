\section{Results}

After building the circuit shown in Figure~\ref{f:astable} with the elements
listed in Table~\ref{t:elements}, the duty cycle and frequency of the output
were measured.  Figure~\ref{f:scope} shows an oscilloscope screenshot of such
measurements, and Table~\ref{t:error} aggregates the error in each
measurement.

\end{figure}
%
The system produced a nearly square wave with a frequency
of~\SI{7.75}{\kilo\hertz}, an error of just~\SI{-3.12}{\percent}.  Remarkably,
the observed duty cycle of the output exhibited an error of
just~\SI{-0.11}{\percent}, measuring~\SI{89.9}{\percent} compared to the
target~\SI{90}{\percent}.
