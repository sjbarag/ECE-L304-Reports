\section{Conclusions}

In conclusion, the constructed 555-based system clock performed surprisingly
well.  With a frequency and duty cycle just~\SI{3.12}{\percent}
and~\SI{0.11}{\percent} below their corresponding target values, the~LM555
proved itself as a reliable and extremely predictable IC.  Additionally, the
accuracy to which the clock signal is produced will likely prove to be very
influential in the later success of the overall voice recording system, as it
drives the address generator (thus allowing accurate RAM storage and
read-back).
