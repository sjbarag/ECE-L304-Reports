\section{Introduction}

Step five of the voice recorder construction involved creating an accurate
clock signal for the address generator and control logic.  While achieving a
specific duty cycle was not necessary, it was required to maintain a consistent
one.  The~555 timer IC was chosen to perform this task, as its astable
oscillator configuration provides just these functions.
