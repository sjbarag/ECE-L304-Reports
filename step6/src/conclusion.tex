\section{Conclusions}

In conclusion, the address generator created in step six worked flawlessly; the
timing of each bit was correct with respect to the clock produced in step five,
as well as relative to each other bit.  By using a JK flip-flop clocked by
the most significant bit produced by the 8-bit counters, a seventeenth bit was
produced.  While students could have simply added a third counter clocked by
that same source, this would have produced seven extra useless bits and would
have added unneeded complexity to the already complex system.

By using two \ttt{AND} gates to delay the clock signal into the JK flip-flop
controlling the read/write state of the system, students were able to ensure
that each generated address was stabilized before reading or writing occurred.
This~\SI{20}{\nano\second} delay prevented data corruption in the RAM, but was
short enough to not significantly affect the voice recorder's functionality.
The system is now ready for its final modifications in the last step.
