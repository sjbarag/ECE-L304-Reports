\section{Introduction}

The sixth and final step in the process of building a digital voice recorder
required students to build a circuit to control the writing to and reading from
the~\SI{1}{\mega\byte} of onboard RAM.  Students constructed a~\SI{17}{bit}
address generator using two~74LS590~\SI{8}{\bit} counters for bits zero through
fifteen and a JK flip-flop for bit sixteen.  A small delay was also introduced
to the system clock in order to ensure that each address has been completely
generated before it is used.  Finally, students connected the \ttt{WE} and
\ttt{OE} (write-enable and output-enable, respectively) pins to the control
system.
