\section{Conclusions}

In conclusion, students simulated a fully functional RAM system in which data
was both stored to and retrieved from the~\SI{64}{kb} RAM chip.   Both the
rudimentary and complex systems exhibited the correct timing behavior, and
reproduced the input data accurately.  While the output of the 8-bit system in
part two showed some anomalies, they are acceptable for the purposes of a basic
voice recorder.  After tuning the complex design so that the anomalies were of
a safe voltage, both systems are ready to be implemented in hardware.
