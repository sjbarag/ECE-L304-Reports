\section{Conclusions}

In conclusion, the constructed system sufficiently recreated the input signal.
With a time for each output voltage of~SI{180}{\micro\second},
or~\SI{68.22}{cycles} of the ADC clock, the system can accurately reproduce a
sinusoidal input of frequency less than~\SI{3}{\kilo\hertz}.  For any value
above this critical frequency, aliasing occurs in the output as shown in
Figure~\ref{f:3000hz}.  While this is less than the ideal maximum frequency of
the speaking range~(\SI{10}{\kilo\hertz}), it will be acceptable for the low
quality of reproduction required for this application.
