\section{Discussion of Results}
For an input of~$1111_2$, the reconfigured DAC does not reach an output voltage
of~\SI{-15}{\volt}, but instead reaches only~\SI{-14.974}{\volt}.  This is
caused by losses within the op amp combined with the fact that the source
voltages were exactly~$\pm\SI{15}{\volt}$.  If the op amp was ideal in its
construction and simulation, the full scale output would equal the negative
supply voltage.  To counteract these losses, the supply voltages could be
increased marginally, or the output voltage could be measured across a low
resistance load resistor to ground.
