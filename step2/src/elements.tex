\section{Design Goals}
Students were required to choose an appropriate internal clock frequency as
defined by the instructor-provided resources.  Once a frequency was chosen,
students used the chart provided in the ADC's datasheet~(reproduced in
Figure~\ref{f:element_chart}) to choose relevant component values.

The student decided upon an internal clock frequency of~\SI{730}{\kilo\hertz}.
By Figure~\ref{f:element_chart}, he also chose to use a~\SI{10}{\kilo\ohm}
resistor and~\SI{\approx150}{\pico\farad}.  After obtaining appropriate
elements, the measured values were as listed in Table~\ref{t:elements}.

\begin{table}[H]

	\caption[Measured element values]{Required, nominal, and measured values
	for the ADC clock frequency elements.}
	\label{t:elements}}
\end{table}
%
As is shown, these elements are very close to the required element values.
This implies that the resulting clock frequency will be similarly close to the
chosen value of~\SI{730}{\kilo\hertz}.
