\section{DC Sweep Results}
In order to test the ADC, a DC sweep was performed for input voltages from zero
to~\SI{5}{\volt}.  At each step~(0,~0.3, and~0.6 volts above each integer
input), the state of the LED output array was recorded.  It is important to
note that the LEDs are active-low, i.e. each is lit by a logic zero and turned
off by a logic one.  Table~\ref{t:dc_sweep} shows the \emph{observed logic
values} at each input voltage.

\end{table}

The above table and the resulting plot in Figure~\ref{f:dc_sweep} shows that
the output increases approximately linearly for the linear voltage sweep with a
resolution of~\SI{\approx51}{\bit\per\volt}.  This is in line with the expected
results, thus maintaining that the device is fully-functional.
