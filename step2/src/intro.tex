\section{Introduction}
Step two in the ECE-L304 voice recorder project requires students to construct
a working analog to digital circuit, similar in design to the one simulated in
week one.  Each student was provided a barebones circuit board for the project,
containing only IC sockets, various interconnect pins, and a pre-soldered RAM
chip.  Students were instructed to make a few connections via wire wrapping
before calculating and installing the elements required for a desired clock
frequency.  When the produced clock frequency was satisfactory, students tested
the ADC function and used a logic analyzer to observe some system
characteristics.
