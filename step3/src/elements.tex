\section{Elements}

After consulting the datasheet for the DAC0808 integrated circuit, it was
determined that three~\SI{5}{\kilo\ohm} resistors were required for the proper
operation of the chip.  The measured values are shown in
Table~\ref{t:elements}, along with the elements used in the construction of the
ADC in step 2 (which utilized the ADC0804 IC).

	values used in the ADC and DAC circuits.}

With errors for the DAC resistors all falling under~\SI{1}{\percent}, the
elements are all appropriately accurate for this application.
