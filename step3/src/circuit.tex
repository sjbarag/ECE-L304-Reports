\section{Circuit}

The circuit used for step three was inspired by the second simulated one from
step one.  With only one minor modification to the reference voltage, an
appropriate schematic is shown in Figure~\ref{f:schem}.

Because the circuit is so similar in design to the one originally described in
step one, a full explanation will be foregone here.  The only modification to
take note of is a change in reference voltage~$V_\text{ref}$
to~\SI{-15}{\volt}.
