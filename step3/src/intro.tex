\section{Introduction}

In step three in the construction of the voice recording circuit, students
incorporated a digital to analog converter~(DAC).  This IC will be used in the
final design to translate the data stored on the RAM chip into a format
appropriate for replay by a standard~\SI{8}{\ohm} speaker.  In its existing
configuration, the input to the DAC was fed directly by the output of the ADC.
As the ADC was a known-working component by this step, this decision was safe
and did not cause any unexpected issues.  Students tested the accuracy of this
ADC/DAC combo by comparing the input and output signals on an oscilloscope.
